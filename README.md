# GTFS_Realtime_Project
This is a repo of the scripts for my GTFS realtime data analysis project

I create an Apache Spark streaming session from City of Boston MBTA real-time bus position data that is ingested with Apache Kafka. 

I will then conduct spatial analysis with Apache Sedona to determine which of two geofences, either Chinatown or the North End of Boston, receives more bus traffic each day.
